## Insights & Findings📊
✅ We analyzed the top 10 hosts to identify the one with the most property listings on Airbnb. Our findings show that Michael holds the top spot with 417 listings, making him the host with the highest number of properties. He is followed by David, who has the second-highest listings at 403. Additionally, our data reveals that 5,154 hosts have more than one listing on Airbnb.

✅ The data shows that only 1,295 listings were available year-round, indicating a limited number of consistently accessible properties. Additionally, the average number of listings per host is just one, suggesting that most hosts manage only a single property.

✅ The dataset includes five distinct neighborhood groups: Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx. Manhattan has the highest number of property listings on Airbnb, with 21,661 listings, while Staten Island has the fewest.

✅ Our dataset includes 221 unique neighborhoods, with Williamsburg standing out as the neighborhood with the most property listings, totaling 3,920 listings. It is followed by Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem, with 3,714 and 2,658 listings, respectively. Fort Wadsworth has the highest average price, at $800.

✅ The Airbnb NYC listings primarily consist of three room categories: Private room, Entire home/apt, and Shared room. Among these, the Entire home/apt has the highest number of listings, making it the most common room type, while the Shared room has the fewest listings. The average price for all listings is $152.72.

✅ According to the dataset, there are a total of 10,052 property listings on Airbnb that have not received a single review. This means that these listings have either not been booked by guests or, if they have been, no feedback has been provided by those who stayed. This lack of reviews could impact the visibility and attractiveness of these listings to potential guests, as reviews often play a significant role in helping users decide on accommodations.

✅On average, Airbnb listings in this dataset require a minimum stay of 7 nights. This indicates that, generally, hosts prefer longer bookings, possibly to reduce the frequency of turnover and related maintenance tasks.
